# My PopClip extensions

These are some personal [PopClip](https://pilotmoon.com/popclip)
extensions I use on a regular basis.

## List of extensions

* **Jira ID**  
  ![Jira ID Sample](https://cdn.rawgit.com/Dreamseer/popclip-extensions/main/jira-id-sample.png)  
  You all know this: The Stake Holder Guy comes along asking “Hey, what about LOLPROJECT-1337? Will it be released next week?”, or the Product Owner Guy asks “Can you put some estimates on AWESOME-42?” And you need to fire up your browser, type in the URL of your Jira installation, append the ticket ID… ugh! Struggle no more, here comes the PopClip Jira ID extension: Just select the ticket ID, click the fancy Jira icon in PopClip and… abracadabra, there you go! Additionally the URL is put into your clipboard.
* **Redact**  
  Replaces selected text with a pre-defined symbol. Useful if the Slack Admin Guy disables deletion of messages while still allowing editing.
* **Open in Chrome Canary**  
  This is almost the same extension as [Open in Chrome](https://pilotmoon.com/popclip/extensions//page/OpenInChrome), but it opens the current URL in Chrome Canary. (You could also use [Choosy](https://www.choosyosx.com/) and the [Choosy PopClip Extension](https://github.com/georgebrock/choosy-popclip).)
